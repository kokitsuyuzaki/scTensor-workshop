## Description

In this workshop (presented in Japanese), you will learn how to detect cell-cell interaction from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data using `scTensor` package. Moreover, you will learn some tensor frameworks of R language and will be able to freely use and decompose your original tensor data.

Expectation: In the first half, you will learn how to use `SingleCellExperiment` object, transform the scRNA-Seq data to higher-order tensor, and apply `scTensor` against it. In the latter half, you will learn some tensor-related R packages.

Pre-requisites: The course is aimed at PhD students, Master’s students, and third & fourth year undergraduate students. Some basic R knowledge is assumed - this is not an introduction to R course. If you are not familiar with the R statistical programming language it is compulsory that you work through an introductory R course before you attend this workshop.
