## Description

In this workshop (presented in Japanese), you will learn how to detect cell-cell interaction from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data using scTensor package. Moreover, you will learn some tensor frameworks of R language and will be able to use and decompose user's original tensor data freely.

Expectation:

In the first half, you will learn how to transform the scRNA-Seq data to higher-order tensor, SingleCellExperiment object



In the latter half,

The material we will be covering on single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis is a subset of the work of Amerzquita et al. (2020) Nature Methods,17:137–145 available at https://osca.bioconductor.org.




Pre-requisites: The course is aimed at PhD students, Master’s students, and third & fourth year undergraduate students. Some basic R knowledge is assumed - this is not an introduction to R course. If you are not familiar with the R statistical programming language it is compulsory that you work through an introductory R course before you attend this workshop.

### Participation

After the lecture, participants are expected to follow along the hands-on session. we highly recommend participants bringing your own laptop.

### _R_ / _Bioconductor_ / _CRAN_ packages used

The following R/Bioconductor packages will be explicitly used:

List any _R_ / _Bioconductor_ / _CRAN_ packages that will be explicitly covered.

* SingleCellExperiment (Bioconductor)
* AnnotationHub (Bioconductor)
* LRBaseDbi (Bioconductor)
* scTensor (Bioconductor)
* einsum (CRAN)
* rTensor (CRAN)
* nnTensor (CRAN)
* HDF5Array (Bioconductor)
* DelayedArray (Bioconductor)
* DelayedTensor (Bioconductor)
* mwTensor (CRAN)

### Time outline

| Activity                                                  | Time|
|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Cell-cell Interaction Analysis by scTensor                | 20m |
| Advanced Topics about Tensor Arithmetic and Decomposition | 30m |
| Q & A                                                     | 10m |








### Workshop goals and objectives

List "big picture" student-centered workshop goals and learning
objectives. Learning goals and objectives are related, but not the
same thing. These goals and objectives will help some people to decide
whether to attend the conference for training purposes, so please make
these as precise and accurate as possible.

*Learning goals* are high-level descriptions of what
participants will learn and be able to do after the workshop is
over. *Learning objectives*, on the other hand, describe in very
specific and measurable terms specific skills or knowledge
attained. The [Bloom's Taxonomy](#bloom) may be a useful framework
for defining and describing your goals and objectives, although there
are others.

### Learning goals

Some examples:

* describe how to...
* identify methods for...
* understand the difference between...

### Learning objectives

* analyze xyz data to produce...
* create xyz plots
* evaluate xyz data for artifacts

## Workshop

Divide the workshop into sections (`## A Section`). Include
fully-evaluated _R_ code chunks. Develop exercises and solutions, and
anticipate that your audience will walk through the code with you, or
work on the code idependently -- do not be too ambitious in the
material that you present.
